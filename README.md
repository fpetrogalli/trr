# The Rhino Run

*The Rhino Run* is a piece for marching band. The piece is dedicated
to the band [Blowcomotion](https://blowcomotion.org/).

The main theme has been invented by my son Olmo, during an
improvisation section at home. It was a lot of fun!

You can listen to the MIDI output of the song on
[soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/francesco-petrogalli/the-rhino-run).
